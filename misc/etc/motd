Welcome to EXNIX!

The message of the day file will be used to explain big kernel changes.

Kernel NOTES:
 - include/param.h: FSSIZE _ONLY_ SUPPORTS up to 5000 blocks on memfs, any
   more will result in serious undocumented issues. Please seriously
   consider code size when writing applications. Currently, 2000 is just
   below enough to compile. We have a _finite_ amount of kernel memfs space
   without some serious refactoring.
 - to compile using memfs, use 'make clean; make qemu-memfs'. Make clean is
   important here, since without it, mkfs will not rebuild the memfs.

Memfs should allow the kernel to be booted on pretty much anything, all you
need is something to emulate IDE (only the master disk) and boot this image.
The kernel image itself contains the filesystem, which I find neat.

Although, SMP is still required. Removing that will be annoying.
